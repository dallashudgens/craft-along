## Playing around with some image options

Trying to figure out the different ways that are possible and the best way to set this up.
Check out my lovely block prints :D

![Rose block print pattern]({{ site.url }}/images/rose-pattern.jpg)

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/red-rose.jpg" alt="block print over red block">

<img src="/images/red-rose.jpg" alt="just plain html">
